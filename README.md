## Installation & setup

In order to use the [football-data API](https://www.football-data.org/documentation/api) you need a personal token,
which you will put in the environment variables (.env) of the project. Make sure to copy the contents of the .env.dist
to the .env for apis to work.

In the root project directory, you can run:

### `npm run install-all-deps`

Installs the client and server dependencies.

### `npm run start-all`

Runs the client and server.
